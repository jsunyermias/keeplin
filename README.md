# Keeplin

A small, self-hostable **notes backend** written in Rust. Keeplin stores notes,
notebooks, tags, and binary attachments, and exposes them over a **gRPC API**. It can run
fully offline against the local filesystem (replicated between devices with
[Syncthing](https://syncthing.net/)) or in server mode against a local
LibSQL/SQLite database that synchronises with a central server over WebSocket. Sensitive
content can be **encrypted at rest** with AES‑256‑GCM.

> **Status:** pre‑release (`0.1.0`). The core is well-tested and solid for **single‑user /
> self‑hosted offline** use. It is **not yet production‑ready as a multi‑user, server‑backed
> service** — see [Project status](#project-status). Formats may still change between
> versions without a migration path.

## Features

- **Entities:** notes (with markdown bodies, to‑do flag, due/completed dates), notebooks,
  tags (many‑to‑many with notes), and binary resources (attachments).
- **Two storage backends**, behind one `StorageBackend` trait:
  - **Offline (`FsBackend`)** — JSON/MessagePack files on disk, replicated by Syncthing.
  - **Server (`DbBackend`)** — local LibSQL (embedded SQLite) + WebSocket sync.
- **Conflict resolution:**
  - Filesystem notes use **per‑note version vectors** with deterministic convergence
    (genuine concurrent edits merge; no silent divergence).
  - Everything else uses **last‑write‑wins** by `updated_at`, with **tombstones** so a
    stale edit can never resurrect a delete.
- **At‑rest encryption:** AES‑256‑GCM with an Argon2id‑derived key (opt‑in).
- **gRPC API** with HTTP Basic Auth (constant‑time check) and optional TLS.
- **Cursor pagination** on every list endpoint.
- **Soft delete** for notes/notebooks/tags; hard delete for resources.

## Architecture

A Cargo workspace with two crates:

| Crate | What it is |
|-------|------------|
| [`keeplin-core`](keeplin-core) | The library: domain models, the `StorageBackend` trait + two implementations (`FsBackend`, `DbBackend`), the `EncryptedBackend` decorator, and the `SyncEngine`. |
| [`keeplin-daemon`](keeplin-daemon) | The binary: a [tonic](https://github.com/hyperium/tonic) gRPC server (`KeeplinService`) that wires a backend to the network, with auth and TLS. |

Every `.rs` source file has a companion `.md` describing it in depth (e.g.
[`keeplin-core/src/storage/fs.md`](keeplin-core/src/storage/fs.md),
[`keeplin-core/src/storage/note_log.md`](keeplin-core/src/storage/note_log.md)).

### Storage models

**Offline mode** stores each note as a directory:

```
notes/{id}/
  note.md                  # the markdown body (ciphertext when encryption is on)
  meta.msgpack             # metadata + merged version vector
  log.{device_id}.msgpack  # append-only, one per device (single-writer → Syncthing-safe)
```

Because each per‑device log has a single writer, Syncthing never produces conflict copies;
a note's state is the **merge** of all its logs (see
[`note_log`](keeplin-core/src/storage/note_log.rs)). Notebooks, tags, and resources are
single MessagePack sidecars plus a per‑device NDJSON change log.

**Server mode** keeps everything in a local SQLite database and ships each mutation as a
`Change` over a WebSocket to a central relay, which forwards it to the other devices.
Conflict resolution here is last‑write‑wins for all entities (no version vectors).

> The two backends are **not interchangeable in one sync topology**, and they differ in
> conflict‑resolution strength — see ["Conflict resolution differs by backend"](SECURITY.md).

---

## Quick start

### Prerequisites

- A recent stable **Rust** toolchain (`rustup`).
- **`protoc`** (Protocol Buffers compiler) — the daemon's `build.rs` compiles the gRPC
  definitions. On Debian/Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install -y protobuf-compiler`.

### Build

```bash
cargo build --release          # produces target/release/keeplin-daemon
```

`scripts/build.sh` cross‑compiles release binaries for several targets (requires the
matching toolchains).

### Configure

Create a `keeplin.toml` (offline mode, no encryption):

```toml
mode      = "offline"
data_dir  = "./keeplin-data"
grpc_addr = "127.0.0.1:50051"
```

Or server mode with auth and encryption (prefer environment variables for secrets):

```toml
mode        = "server"
data_dir    = "./keeplin-data"
server_url  = "wss://sync.example.com/ws"   # use wss:// (TLS) in production
auth_token  = ""                            # set via env if needed
grpc_addr   = "127.0.0.1:50051"
# tls_cert_path = "/etc/keeplin/cert.pem"
# tls_key_path  = "/etc/keeplin/key.pem"
```

```bash
export KEEPLIN_ENCRYPTION_PASSWORD="…"   # enables AES-256-GCM at-rest encryption
export KEEPLIN_KEY_SALT="…"              # required (same on every device) for encrypted multi-device sync
export KEEPLIN_AUTH_USERNAME="alice"
export KEEPLIN_AUTH_PASSWORD="…"
```

### Run

```bash
./target/release/keeplin-daemon --config keeplin.toml
```

The daemon serves `KeeplinService` on `grpc_addr` and shuts down cleanly on `Ctrl‑C`.

## Configuration reference

All fields live in `keeplin.toml`; the four secrets can be overridden by the environment
variables shown.

| Field | Default | Description |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `mode` | `offline` | `offline` (filesystem) or `server` (database + WebSocket). |
| `data_dir` | `./keeplin-data` | Root directory for files, or location of the `.db`. |
| `server_url` | `""` | WebSocket sync URL (server mode). Use `wss://` in production. |
| `auth_token` | `""` | Bearer token sent on the first WebSocket frame (server mode). |
| `grpc_addr` | `127.0.0.1:50051` | gRPC listen address. |
| `http_addr` | `none` | Optional HTTP listen address for the REST/JSON API + WebSocket feed (e.g. `127.0.0.1:50052`). Plain HTTP — front with a TLS proxy. Same Basic‑Auth credentials apply. |
| `tls_cert_path` / `tls_key_path` | `none` | PEM cert/key; set both to enable TLS. |
| `max_message_size` | 32 MiB | Max gRPC message size (in/out). |
| `journal_retention_days` | `30` | Days of change‑journal history to keep; pruned after each sync (`0` disables; no‑op for the filesystem backend). |
| `encryption_password` | `none` | Enables at‑rest encryption. Env: `KEEPLIN_ENCRYPTION_PASSWORD`. |
| `key_salt` | `none` (→ device ID) | Argon2id salt (≥ 8 bytes); set the **same** value on all synced devices for portable encryption. Env: `KEEPLIN_KEY_SALT`. |
| `auth_username` / `auth_password` | `none` | gRPC Basic Auth; when both are set, every call must authenticate. Env: `KEEPLIN_AUTH_USERNAME` / `KEEPLIN_AUTH_PASSWORD`. |

The daemon logs a loud warning if it binds a non‑loopback address without auth, or if
encryption is on without `key_salt`.

---

## gRPC API

The service is defined in
[`keeplin-daemon/proto/keeplin.proto`](keeplin-daemon/proto/keeplin.proto). `KeeplinService`
provides CRUD + paginated list RPCs for **notes, notebooks, tags, and resources**, the
note↔tag association RPCs, the **bookmark/link** RPCs (`SetNoteAlias`, `SetNotebookAlias`,
`EditBookmarkAlias`, `AddNoteLink`, `RemoveNoteLink`, `ListBacklinks`, `ResolveReference` —
see [Bookmarks & links](#bookmarks--links)), and a server‑streaming **`Sync`** RPC that
reports progress through one sync cycle. Authentication is HTTP Basic Auth via the
`authorization` metadata header: `Basic base64(user:password)`.

---

## REST API

When `http_addr` is set, the daemon also serves a REST/JSON API on that address, sharing the
same storage backend and the same Basic‑Auth credentials as gRPC. Requests and responses are
JSON over the domain models; authenticate with the standard `Authorization: Basic
base64(user:password)` header (only required when `auth_username`/`auth_password` are set).

| Method & path | Purpose |
|---------------|---------|
| `GET /api/health` | Liveness probe (`200 ok`). |
| `GET /api/notes?page_size=&page_token=` | List notes (cursor pagination → `{ items, next_page_token }`). |
| `POST /api/notes` | Create a note. |
| `GET/PUT/DELETE /api/notes/:id` | Read / update / soft‑delete a note. |
| `GET /api/notes/:id/tags` | List a note's tags. |
| `PUT/DELETE /api/notes/:note_id/tags/:tag_id` | Add / remove a note↔tag association. |
| `GET/POST /api/notebooks`, `GET/PUT/DELETE /api/notebooks/:id` | Notebook CRUD. |
| `GET/POST /api/tags`, `GET/PUT/DELETE /api/tags/:id` | Tag CRUD. |
| `GET/POST /api/resources`, `GET/PUT/DELETE /api/resources/:id` | Resource metadata CRUD. |
| `GET /api/resources/:id/data` | Download the raw resource bytes. |
| `PUT /api/notes/:id/alias`, `PUT /api/notebooks/:id/alias` | Set/clear an alias (`{ "alias": "…" \| null }`). |
| `GET /api/notes/:id/bookmarks` | List a note's bookmarks. |
| `PUT /api/notes/:id/bookmarks/:number/alias` | Edit a bookmark's alias (`{ "alias": "…" }`). |
| `GET/POST /api/notes/:id/links` | List / add a link (`POST {"raw":"#…"}`, manual link). |
| `DELETE /api/notes/:id/links/:index` | Remove the link at `index`. |
| `GET /api/notes/:id/backlinks` | Notes that link **to** this note. |
| `GET /api/links/resolve?ref=#…` | Resolve a reference → `{ "note_id", "bookmark_number" }`. |
| `POST /api/sync` | Run one sync cycle; returns `{ "applied": <n> }`. |
| `GET /api/ws` | Upgrade to the WebSocket live‑change feed (see below). |

Resource upload is a raw request body: `POST /api/resources?title=&file_name=` with the
file bytes as the body and the `Content-Type` header as the MIME type. Reads of a
soft‑deleted note, notebook, or tag return `404` (the gRPC `Get` RPCs still return the
tombstone for sync). Errors map to `404` (not found), `409` (duplicate alias), `422`
(corrupted data / invalid link reference), `400` (invalid UUID/body), and `500` otherwise.

The HTTP listener is **plain HTTP** — terminate TLS at a reverse proxy in production, exactly
as for the WebSocket sync token.

### WebSocket live‑change feed

`GET /api/ws` upgrades to a WebSocket that pushes a **live feed of changes**: after every
successful mutation — from gRPC *or* REST — the daemon broadcasts the corresponding
[`Change`](keeplin-core/src/models.rs) to all connected clients as a JSON text frame
(`{"op":"note_create","note":{…}}`, `{"op":"note_delete","id":…}`, …). The upgrade request
passes through the same Basic‑Auth check as the REST routes.

The feed is **best‑effort**, not a durable log: a client that falls behind the server's
buffer receives a single `{"type":"resync"}` hint and should reload state from the REST API;
the authoritative history remains the per‑device change journal used by sync. Resource
creates are streamed as metadata only — fetch the bytes via `GET /api/resources/:id/data`.
Changes are broadcast in plaintext (the daemon is the trust boundary), so at‑rest encryption
does not obscure them from connected clients.

```bash
# Watch the feed while creating a note from another terminal:
websocat ws://127.0.0.1:50052/api/ws
curl -X POST 127.0.0.1:50052/api/notes -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"title":"hi","body":"there"}'
```

## Bookmarks & links

Notes carry two kinds of in‑content navigation, both stored on the note (in `meta.msgpack`
for the filesystem backend, in the `notes` row for the database backend) and synced like any
other note edit.

**Bookmarks (marcadores)** are in‑note anchors written as a **triple‑hash token** in the
body — `###Marcador1` (a hashtag with three `#`). Each bookmark's `text` is the marked word,
its `number` is its 1‑based position among the note's bookmarks, and its `alias` defaults to
the text but can be edited (the edit survives later body changes). A `### ` markdown heading
(space after the hashes) and a longer `####` run are **not** bookmarks.

**Links (enlaces)** connect notes. They are either **content‑derived** — a standard markdown
link whose destination starts with `#`, e.g. `[texto](#libreta1#nota3#5)` — or **manual**
(added via the API, not present in the body). A reference uses this grammar:

| Form | Resolves to |
|------|-------------|
| `#<note>` | a note, by **alias or uuid** |
| `#<notebook>#<note>` | a note scoped by notebook (each **alias or uuid**) |
| `#<notebook>#<note>#<bookmark>` | a note + bookmark (bookmark by **alias or number**) |

For example `#libreta1#nota3#marcador5` (bookmark by alias) or `#libreta1#nota3#5` (by
number). The two‑segment form is always `notebook#note`, so a bookmark target needs the full
three‑segment form. Note and notebook **aliases** are user‑assigned and unique among live
entities of each type (a duplicate is rejected with `409`/`ALREADY_EXISTS`); concurrent
cross‑device edits can still introduce a collision through sync, in which case resolution
deterministically picks the smallest‑uuid match and logs a warning. Each link records a
best‑effort `target_note_id`; `GET /api/links/resolve` (or the `ResolveReference` RPC) resolves
a reference on demand, and `GET /api/notes/:id/backlinks` lists the notes pointing at a note.

---

## Development

```bash
cargo test --workspace                              # full test suite
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo fmt --all --check
```

The suite includes unit tests for the version‑vector merge, integration tests for both
backends and the encryption layer, two‑device convergence tests, and an **end‑to‑end
WebSocket sync test** (`keeplin-core/tests/ws_sync.rs`) that stands up an in‑process relay.
CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs check, test, clippy, and `cargo audit`.

---

## Security

See [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md) for the encryption scheme, threat model, the per‑backend
conflict‑resolution difference, and known limitations (plaintext WebSocket token without
TLS, unsupported mixed‑backend sync, last‑write‑wins trade‑offs).

---

## Project status

**Ready** for single‑user, self‑hosted **offline** use (`FsBackend` + Syncthing): the
filesystem note model is well‑tested and converges deterministically.

**Not yet production‑ready** as a multi‑user, server‑backed service. Outstanding work,
roughly in priority order:

1. **No production sync server** ships in this repo — server mode needs a real relay
   (the WebSocket path is now covered end‑to‑end by a test‑only relay).
2. `DbBackend` resolves note conflicts by last‑write‑wins (no version‑vector merge).
3. Operability: metrics, health checks, and a schema/format **migration path**.
4. Performance at scale: filesystem reads materialize from logs (no compaction yet).
5. Hardening: `wss://`/TLS by default, chunked upload for large attachments.
