# Keeplin

A small, self-hostable **notes backend** written in Rust. Keeplin stores notes,
notebooks, tags, and binary attachments, and exposes them over a **gRPC API**. It can run
fully offline against the local filesystem (replicated between devices with
[Syncthing](https://syncthing.net/)) or in server mode against a local
LibSQL/SQLite database that synchronises with a central server over WebSocket. Sensitive
content can be **encrypted at rest** with AES‑256‑GCM.

> **Status:** pre‑release (`0.1.0`). The core is well-tested and solid for **single‑user /
> self‑hosted offline** use. It is **not yet production‑ready as a multi‑user, server‑backed
> service** — see [Project status](#project-status). Formats may still change between
> versions without a migration path.

## Features

- **Entities:** notes (with markdown bodies, to‑do flag, due/completed dates), notebooks,
  tags (many‑to‑many with notes), and binary resources (attachments).
- **Two storage backends**, behind one `StorageBackend` trait:
  - **Offline (`FsBackend`)** — JSON/MessagePack files on disk, replicated by Syncthing.
  - **Server (`DbBackend`)** — local LibSQL (embedded SQLite) + WebSocket sync.
- **Conflict resolution:**
  - **Every entity** — notes, notebooks, tags, note↔tag associations, and resources —
    converges through **version vectors** with a deterministic `(timestamp, device_id)`
    tiebreak (genuine concurrent edits resolve the same way on every device; no silent
    divergence). Filesystem notes carry per‑note version‑vector logs; everything else
    carries a version vector on its record.
  - Every delete is a **versioned tombstone** that competes in the same resolution, so a
    stale edit can never resurrect a delete and a stale delete can never clobber a newer edit.
- **At‑rest encryption:** AES‑256‑GCM with an Argon2id‑derived key (opt‑in).
- **gRPC API** with HTTP Basic Auth (constant‑time check) and optional TLS.
- **Cursor pagination** on every list endpoint.
- **Soft delete** (versioned tombstones) for every entity, resources included.

## Architecture

A Cargo workspace with two crates:

| Crate | What it is |
|-------|------------|
| [`keeplin-core`](keeplin-core) | The library: domain models, the `StorageBackend` supertrait + two implementations (`FsBackend`, `DbBackend`), the `EncryptedBackend` and `LinkingBackend` decorators, the bookmark/link grammar, and the `SyncEngine`. |
| [`keeplin-daemon`](keeplin-daemon) | The binary: a [tonic](https://github.com/hyperium/tonic) gRPC server (`KeeplinService`) plus an optional [axum](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum) REST/WebSocket surface, both sharing one backend, with auth and TLS. It adds the outermost `EventBackend` (live‑change feed). |

Backends compose as a **decorator stack** — innermost storage outward:

```
EventBackend( LinkingBackend( [EncryptedBackend]( Fs | Db ) ) )
```

For a one‑page tour of how it all fits together, read
[`ARCHITECTURE.md`](ARCHITECTURE.md). Every `.rs` source file also has a companion `.md`
describing it in depth (e.g. [`keeplin-core/src/storage/fs.md`](keeplin-core/src/storage/fs.md),
[`keeplin-core/src/storage/note_log.md`](keeplin-core/src/storage/note_log.md)).

### Storage models

**Offline mode** stores each note as a directory:

```
notes/{id}/
  note.md                  # the markdown body (ciphertext when encryption is on)
  meta.msgpack             # metadata + merged version vector
  log.{device_id}.msgpack  # append-only, one per device (single-writer → Syncthing-safe)
```

Because each per‑device log has a single writer, Syncthing never produces conflict copies;
a note's state is the **merge** of all its logs (see
[`note_log`](keeplin-core/src/storage/note_log.rs)). Notebooks, tags, and resources are
single MessagePack sidecars plus a per‑device NDJSON change log.

**Server mode** keeps everything in a local SQLite database and ships each mutation as a
`Change` over a WebSocket to a central relay, which forwards it to the other devices.
Conflict resolution here is the **same version‑vector `resolve`** applied to current‑state rows,
so it converges identically to offline mode — only the storage shape (rows vs. per‑device logs)
differs.

> The two backends are **not interchangeable in one *live* sync topology** (different transports),
> but they share the same version‑vector convergence — see
> ["Conflict resolution is unified on version vectors"](SECURITY.md#conflict-resolution-is-unified-on-version-vectors).
> You **can** do a one‑shot copy of a store from one backend to the other — see
> [Migrating between backends](#migrating-between-backends).

## Quick start

### Prerequisites

- A recent stable **Rust** toolchain (`rustup`).
- **`protoc`** (Protocol Buffers compiler) — the daemon's `build.rs` compiles the gRPC
  definitions. On Debian/Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install -y protobuf-compiler`.

### Build

```bash
cargo build --release          # produces target/release/keeplin-daemon
```

`scripts/build.sh` cross‑compiles release binaries for several targets (requires the
matching toolchains).

### Configure

Create a `keeplin.toml` (offline mode, no encryption):

```toml
mode      = "offline"
data_dir  = "./keeplin-data"
grpc_addr = "127.0.0.1:50051"
```

Or server mode with auth and encryption (prefer environment variables for secrets):

```toml
mode        = "server"
data_dir    = "./keeplin-data"
server_url  = "wss://sync.example.com/ws"   # use wss:// (TLS) in production
auth_token  = ""                            # set via env if needed
grpc_addr   = "127.0.0.1:50051"
# tls_cert_path = "/etc/keeplin/cert.pem"
# tls_key_path  = "/etc/keeplin/key.pem"
```

```bash
export KEEPLIN_ENCRYPTION_PASSWORD="…"   # enables AES-256-GCM at-rest encryption
export KEEPLIN_KEY_SALT="…"              # required (same on every device) for encrypted multi-device sync
export KEEPLIN_AUTH_USERNAME="alice"
export KEEPLIN_AUTH_PASSWORD="…"
```

### Run

```bash
./target/release/keeplin-daemon --config keeplin.toml
```

The daemon serves `KeeplinService` on `grpc_addr` and shuts down cleanly on `Ctrl‑C`.

## Configuration reference

All fields live in `keeplin.toml`; the four secrets can be overridden by the environment
variables shown.

| Field | Default | Description |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `mode` | `offline` | `offline` (filesystem) or `server` (database + WebSocket). |
| `data_dir` | `./keeplin-data` | Root directory for files, or location of the `.db`. |
| `server_url` | `""` | WebSocket sync URL (server mode). Use `wss://` in production. |
| `auth_token` | `""` | Bearer token sent on the first WebSocket frame (server mode). |
| `grpc_addr` | `127.0.0.1:50051` | gRPC listen address. |
| `http_addr` | `none` | Optional HTTP listen address for the REST/JSON API + WebSocket feed (e.g. `127.0.0.1:50052`). Plain HTTP — front with a TLS proxy. Same Basic‑Auth credentials apply. |
| `tls_cert_path` / `tls_key_path` | `none` | PEM cert/key; set both to enable TLS. |
| `max_message_size` | 32 MiB | Max gRPC message size (in/out). |
| `journal_retention_days` | `30` | Days of change‑journal history to keep; pruned after each sync (`0` disables; no‑op for the filesystem backend). |
| `encryption_password` | `none` | Enables at‑rest encryption. Env: `KEEPLIN_ENCRYPTION_PASSWORD`. |
| `key_salt` | `none` (→ device ID) | Argon2id salt (≥ 8 bytes); set the **same** value on all synced devices for portable encryption. Env: `KEEPLIN_KEY_SALT`. |
| `auth_username` / `auth_password` | `none` | gRPC Basic Auth; when both are set, every call must authenticate. Env: `KEEPLIN_AUTH_USERNAME` / `KEEPLIN_AUTH_PASSWORD`. |

The daemon logs a loud warning if it binds a non‑loopback address without auth, or if
encryption is on without `key_salt`.

---

## gRPC API

The service is defined in
[`keeplin-daemon/proto/keeplin.proto`](keeplin-daemon/proto/keeplin.proto). `KeeplinService`
provides CRUD + paginated list RPCs for **notes, notebooks, tags, and resources**, the
note↔tag association RPCs, the **alias/link** RPCs (`SetNoteAlias`, `SetNotebookAlias`,
`AddNoteLink`, `RemoveNoteLink`, `ListBacklinks`, `ResolveReference`,
`ListAliasConflicts` — see [Bookmarks & links](#bookmarks--links)), and a server‑streaming **`Sync`** RPC that
reports progress through one sync cycle. Authentication is HTTP Basic Auth via the
`authorization` metadata header: `Basic base64(user:password)`.

---

## REST API

When `http_addr` is set, the daemon also serves a REST/JSON API on that address, sharing the
same storage backend and the same Basic‑Auth credentials as gRPC. Requests and responses are
JSON over the domain models; authenticate with the standard `Authorization: Basic
base64(user:password)` header (only required when `auth_username`/`auth_password` are set).

| Method & path | Purpose |
|---------------|---------|
| `GET /api/health` | Liveness probe (`200 ok`); no auth, does not touch storage. |
| `GET /api/ready` | Readiness probe: one backend read → `200 ready` or `503` when storage is unreachable; no auth. |
| `GET /api/metrics` | Prometheus metrics exposition (`text/plain`); no auth. |
| `GET /api/notes?page_size=&page_token=` | List notes (cursor pagination → `{ items, next_page_token }`). |
| `POST /api/notes` | Create a note. |
| `GET/PUT/DELETE /api/notes/:id` | Read / update / soft‑delete a note. |
| `GET /api/notes/:id/tags` | List a note's tags. |
| `PUT/DELETE /api/notes/:note_id/tags/:tag_id` | Add / remove a note↔tag association. Adding returns `404` when the note or tag is missing or deleted (no dangling associations). |
| `GET/POST /api/notebooks`, `GET/PUT/DELETE /api/notebooks/:id` | Notebook CRUD. |
| `GET/POST /api/tags`, `GET/PUT/DELETE /api/tags/:id` | Tag CRUD. |
| `GET/POST /api/resources`, `GET/PUT/DELETE /api/resources/:id` | Resource metadata CRUD. |
| `GET /api/resources/:id/data` | Download the raw resource bytes. |
| `PUT /api/notes/:id/alias`, `PUT /api/notebooks/:id/alias` | Set/clear an alias (`{ "alias": "…" \| null }`). |
| `GET/POST /api/notes/:id/links` | List / add a link (`POST {"raw":"#…"}`, manual link). |
| `DELETE /api/notes/:id/links/:index` | Remove the link at `index`. |
| `GET /api/notes/:id/backlinks?page_size=&page_token=` | Notes that link **to** this note (cursor pagination). |
| `GET /api/links/resolve?ref=#…` | Resolve a reference → `{ "note_id", "bookmark_number" }`. |
| `GET /api/aliases/conflicts` | Aliases shared by 2+ live notes/notebooks (sync collisions). |
| `POST /api/sync` | Run one sync cycle; returns `{ "applied": <n> }`. Prunes journal history older than `journal_retention_days` afterwards, like the gRPC `Sync` RPC. |
| `GET /api/ws` | Upgrade to the WebSocket live‑change feed (see below). |

Resource upload is a raw request body: `POST /api/resources?title=&file_name=` with the
file bytes as the body and the `Content-Type` header as the MIME type. The request body is
capped at `max_message_size` (32 MiB by default), matching the gRPC limit. Reads **and
updates** of a soft‑deleted note, notebook, or tag return `404` (the gRPC `Get` RPCs still
return the tombstone for sync, but the `Update` RPCs answer `NOT_FOUND` too) — an edit can
never silently revive a deleted entity; revival happens only through sync, when a causal
edit made after the delete arrives. Errors map to `404` (not found), `409` (duplicate alias), `422`
(corrupted data / invalid link reference), `400` (invalid UUID/body), and `500` otherwise.

The HTTP listener is **plain HTTP** — terminate TLS at a reverse proxy in production, exactly
as for the WebSocket sync token.

### WebSocket live‑change feed

`GET /api/ws` upgrades to a WebSocket that pushes a **live feed of changes**: after every
successful mutation — from gRPC *or* REST — the daemon broadcasts the corresponding
[`Change`](keeplin-core/src/models.rs) to all connected clients as a JSON text frame
(`{"op":"note_create","note":{…}}`, `{"op":"note_delete","id":…}`, …). The upgrade request
passes through the same Basic‑Auth check as the REST routes.

The feed is **best‑effort**, not a durable log: a client that falls behind the server's
buffer receives a single `{"type":"resync"}` hint and should reload state from the REST API;
the authoritative history remains the per‑device change journal used by sync. Resource
creates are streamed as metadata only — fetch the bytes via `GET /api/resources/:id/data`.
Changes are broadcast in plaintext (the daemon is the trust boundary), so at‑rest encryption
does not obscure them from connected clients.

```bash
# Watch the feed while creating a note from another terminal:
websocat ws://127.0.0.1:50052/api/ws
curl -X POST 127.0.0.1:50052/api/notes -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"title":"hi","body":"there"}'
```

---

## Bookmarks & links

Notes carry two kinds of in‑content navigation, both stored on the note (in `meta.msgpack`
for the filesystem backend, in the `notes` row for the database backend) and synced like any
other note edit.

**Bookmarks** are in‑note anchors written as a **markdown link whose destination is exactly
`###`** — a link that goes nowhere:

```markdown
[Bookmark text](### "Bookmark alias")
```

The link **text** becomes the bookmark's `text`; the optional link **title** (in quotes) is its
`alias`, defaulting to the text when omitted (`[Bookmark text](###)`); its `number` is its
1‑based position among the note's bookmarks. The **body is the single source of truth**: there
is **no bookmark API** — you create, rename, and delete bookmarks by editing the note body.
The derived bookmarks are returned inline in the `bookmarks` field of each note (over gRPC and
REST) so clients can display and reference them.

**Links** connect notes. They are either **content‑derived** — a standard markdown link whose
destination starts with `#`, e.g. `[text](#notebook1#note3#5)` — or **manual** (added via the
API, not present in the body). A reference uses this grammar:

| Form | Resolves to |
|------|-------------|
| `#<note>` | a note, by **alias or uuid** |
| `#<notebook>#<note>` | a note scoped by notebook (each **alias or uuid**) |
| `#<note>#<bookmark>` | a note + bookmark (shorthand; see below) |
| `#<notebook>#<note>#<bookmark>` | a note + bookmark (bookmark by **alias or number**) |

For example `#notebook1#note3#anchor5` (bookmark by alias) or `#notebook1#note3#5` (by
number). A two‑segment `#a#b` is resolved as `notebook#note` when `b` is a resolvable note;
otherwise it falls back to `note#bookmark` (so `#note3#anchor5` / `#note3#5` targets a
bookmark without naming a notebook). Note and notebook **aliases** are user‑assigned and unique
among live entities of each type (a duplicate is rejected with `409`/`ALREADY_EXISTS`);
concurrent cross‑device edits can still introduce a collision through sync, in which case
resolution deterministically picks the smallest‑uuid match and logs a warning, and the
collision is listed by `GET /api/aliases/conflicts` (or `ListAliasConflicts`) so it can be
cleaned up. Each link records a best‑effort `target_note_id`; `GET /api/links/resolve` (or the
`ResolveReference` RPC) resolves a reference on demand, and `GET /api/notes/:id/backlinks`
lists the notes pointing at a note (answered by an indexed `note_links` projection in
`DbBackend`, and a scan in `FsBackend`).

> **Note on resolution cost.** Writing a note that *contains* links (or that sets an alias)
> scans the note corpus to resolve alias references and enforce alias uniqueness; a plain note
> with no alias and no links skips the scan. There is deliberately no alias→uuid index: alias
> resolution runs above the encryption boundary on decrypted values, and under at‑rest
> encryption the stored alias is per‑write ciphertext, so a database index could not answer an
> alias lookup. For large corpora, prefer referencing notes by uuid.

---

## Migrating between backends

You can copy a whole store from one backend to the other — `offline` (FsBackend) ↔ `server`
(DbBackend), in either direction:

```bash
keeplin-daemon migrate --from source.toml --to dest.toml
```

Each side is described by its **own** config file, so any combination works: filesystem ↔
database, and plaintext ↔ encrypted (even with a different `key_salt`/password on each side —
the copy reads decrypted from the source and re‑encrypts for the destination). The command
prints a per‑entity count and exits; it does not start the server.

It copies notes (with their `alias`/`bookmarks`/`links`), notebooks, tags, note↔tag
associations, and resources (metadata **and** bytes), rebuilding the destination's own indexes
(e.g. `DbBackend`'s backlink projection) as it goes.

**Scope:** this is a **one‑shot copy of current live state into a fresh destination**, not
live sync. Soft‑deleted (tombstoned) items are not carried, and the destination should be
empty (entities keep their original ids, so re‑importing an existing id errors). After
migrating, each backend continues with its own native replication (Syncthing or WebSocket).

---

## Development

```bash
cargo test --workspace                              # full test suite
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo fmt --all --check
```

The suite includes unit tests for the version‑vector merge, integration tests for both
backends and the encryption layer, two‑device convergence tests, and an **end‑to‑end
WebSocket sync test** (`keeplin-core/tests/ws_sync.rs`) that stands up an in‑process relay.
CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs fmt, test, clippy (`--all-targets`), and `cargo audit`.

---

## Security

See [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md) for the encryption scheme, threat model, the per‑backend
conflict‑resolution difference, and known limitations (plaintext WebSocket token without
TLS, unsupported mixed‑backend sync, last‑write‑wins trade‑offs).

---

## Project status

**Ready** for single‑user, self‑hosted **offline** use (`FsBackend` + Syncthing): the
filesystem note model is well‑tested and converges deterministically.

**Not yet production‑ready** as a multi‑user, server‑backed service. Outstanding work,
roughly in priority order:

1. **No production sync server** ships in this repo — server mode needs a real relay
   (the WebSocket path is now covered end‑to‑end by a test‑only relay).
2. Operability: liveness/readiness probes and Prometheus metrics ship (`GET /api/health`,
   `/api/ready`, `/api/metrics`), and both backends now carry a **versioned migration path**
   (`DbBackend` via `PRAGMA user_version`, `FsBackend` via a stamped format ladder, each with
   a downgrade guard).
3. Performance at scale: `FsBackend` list reads re‑merge every note's per‑device logs
   on each call (the logs themselves are compacted automatically, but reads use no
   cached projection).
4. Hardening: `wss://`/TLS by default, chunked upload for large attachments.
